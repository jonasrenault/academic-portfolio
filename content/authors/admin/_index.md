I am a senior research engineer specialized in web and software development for data management, analysis & visualization. Through my work in public research labs such as INRIA or CNRS, I help researchers develop, publish and maintain state of the art tools for such tasks. 

I focus on contributing to open-source projects, working with multidisciplinary teams, and getting involved in current social and political topics through the development of human-focused software. 

My background in philosophy has led me to take a specific interest in contemporary political philosophy, postmodern critical social theory, as well as problematics of subjectivation and bodies in feminist philosophy. I am also interested in contemporary art practices and questions of design and visualization in digital sciences. This impacts my work as a research engineer in computer science where I pay special attention to the links between numerical and social sciences.
